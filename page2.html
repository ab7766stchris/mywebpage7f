 Tennis rackets have been extremely developed over the years. Since the nineteen eightees, 
     high-end tennis rackets have been made from fibre-reinforced composite materials, 
      such as fibreglass, carbon fibre and strong fibres. The advantage 
      of these materials over wood and metal is their high stiffness and low density, 
      combined with manufacturing versatility. Despite the higher swing speed achieved with a lighter racquet, ball speeds tend to remain similar as the increased racket speed is counteracted by the reduction in striking mass. There is most likely an optimum racquet for each player, rather than a one-size-fits-all solution, and player preference is an important consideration. Customisation techniques and player monitoring using sensor and camera systems are likely to play an important role in the future of tennis racquet design.
Modern composite tennis racquets are made using labour intensive processes that are not very environmentally friendly. We may see racquet manufacturers exploring more sustainable materials, such as recycled and natural fibre composites, and more automated manufacturing techniques like additive manufacturing. We might monitor how a player swings a racket using a sensor, and then manufacture them a customised racquet optimised to their playing style.
The development of the tennis on display at the Australian Open has been bound to the evolving design of the racquet. Researchers have calculated that a player could serve the ball around 17.5% faster using a modern racquet than with those used by the first players in the 1870s. No doubt we will see further advances in racquet design shape the sport into the future. </h1> </p>
