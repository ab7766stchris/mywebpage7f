    <p> Tennis rackets have been extremely developed over the years. Since the 1980s,
      
     high-end tennis rackets have been made from fibre-reinforced composite materials, 
      such as fibreglass, carbon fibre and strong fibres. The advantage 
      of these materials over wood and metal is their high stiffness and low density, 
      combined with manufacturing versatility.</p>
